Mission: The Halls of the Dead
Objective: Enter and Traverse the Catacombs

To enter the Factory, you need a key. We stole one, but the agent who had it is missing in the Catacombs beneath the Commons. There's something down there taking our men. Whatever it is, you have to find it and retrieve the key. When you've got it, the Factory is next to the Mines.

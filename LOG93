Mission: The Halls of the Dead
Objective: Retrieve the Key in the Ruins

The Factory is next to the mines. Richter must mean the Mines of Degnin. The Degnin Ore is magnetic and explosive; just the thing for shutting down force fields. Let's get that key from the Catacombs, and then we go down for some ore. This must be the ruin Richter's agent's were searching for; be careful.

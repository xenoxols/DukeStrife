Mission: The Mines of Degnin
Objective: Acquire Degnin Ore

The Factory is next to the mines. Richter must mean the Mines of Degnin. The Degnin Ore is magnetic and explosive; just the thing for shutting down force fields. My friend, whatever it is we're fighting, it's more than just the Order. Back to the Commons, then off to the Mines. We need ore.

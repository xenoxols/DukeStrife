Mission: The Mines of Degnin
Objective: Acquire Degnin Ore

The Factory is next to the mines. Without letting down your guard, look for deposits of ore. My suggestion is, toss the ore at the force field and then blast it; the resulting compression should create a magnetic blanket and turn off the lights.
